# Usage
Download a Wikipedia article abstract dump. You can download the [English Wikipedia article abstracts dump](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract.xml.gz) here.

If you are on Linux and have recent npm and node installed, run `./generate-dump.sh DUMPNAME`. If you have another platform, read what the script does and do it manually. This will take a long time and output progress in %.

Add `assets/generated/` to IPFS. Substitute the text _TO BE ADDED LATER; WILL BE GENERATED BY PUTTING THE INV AND INX INTO IPFS_ with the generated address. You should get something like this in meta.json: `"invURLBase":"/ipfs/QmcfQZFB2eiyU4S1Qy1i55B8tExHgqwT3MtnAt9KxUKfqU/inv/","inxURLBase":"/ipfs/QmcfQZFB2eiyU4S1Qy1i55B8tExHgqwT3MtnAt9KxUKfqU/inx/"`.

Add meta.json to IPFS, associate that with an IPNS link and voil√†, you have created your own ipfsearch index of wikipedia article abstracts.
